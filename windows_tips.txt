DW GENERATOR TIPS FOR WINDOWS

- Download the dwgenerator from https://github.com/TopOfMinds/dw-generator. You can download a zip from the green "CODE" button to the top right. 
- Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- After installing, add the path to Pyhton.exe and the Scripts folder to your system environment PATH variable. If you are unable to do this,
you must specify the full path to both python.exe and to the Scripts folder (where the dwgenerator will be installed) each time you want to run it. 
- Unzip the dwgenerator download. The unzipped path will be: <dir>\dw-generator-master\dw-generator-master\
- Standing in the above directory, run the command "python (or full path to python.exe if no variables) -m pip install -e ." 
The additional -e before the . installs it in developer mode which is useful if you want to make additions to the dwgenerator. 

You have now installed the dwgenerator!

To test it is working, just type "dwgenerator --help" and see you get the help command listed. If you don't have a path variable set to your Scripts
folder in python install directory, you need to instead type "<path to Python Scripts folder>\dwgenerator.exe --help"

Next you need to set up the folder structure for your metadata mappings and the generated sql. Do this in your code repository project folder
(whatever you are using where you are) - not in your python or dwgenerator folders. 
The folder structure to set up is:
<project name>/
    metadata/
        target_tables.csv
        table_def/
            <schema name 1>/
                <table name 1>.csv
                ...
                <table name m>.csv
            ...
            <schema name n>/
        mapping/
            table/
                <table mappings 1>.csv
                ...
            column/
                <column mappings 1>.csv
                ...
    sql/
        <db name>/
            <schema name 1>/
                <table ddl name 1>.sql
                ...
                <table ddl name m>.sql
            ...
            <schema name n>/
			
The readme file included in the dwgenerator-master you downloaded will detail what each of the csv files should look like. Replace the <> values
in above example with whatever repository project, database and schema names you will be using. 

Now you are ready to use your dwgenerator! the main command is the generate-views which will create views or table sql in the sql part of the above structure.
